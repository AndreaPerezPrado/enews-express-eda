# Healthcare A/B Testing & Conversion Analysis — E-News Express

## Project Overview
This project applies **A/B testing and statistical hypothesis testing** to evaluate the effectiveness of a new landing page for an online news platform (E-News Express). The analysis mirrors **healthcare and insurance analytics workflows**, where measuring intervention impact, engagement behavior, and outcome improvement is critical for data-driven decision-making.

The objective is to determine whether the new landing page leads to a statistically significant improvement in user conversion and engagement, enabling leadership to make informed rollout decisions.

---

## Project Objectives
- Evaluate whether the new landing page improves conversion rates
- Compare user engagement metrics between control and treatment groups
- Apply hypothesis testing to validate observed differences
- Translate statistical findings into clear business recommendations

---

## Data Description
The dataset includes simulated user-level interaction data capturing:
- Conversion status
- Time spent on the page
- Control vs. treatment group assignment
- Engagement-related metrics relevant to decision analysis

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured experimentation framework:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior patterns
- Segmented users into control and treatment groups
- Performed hypothesis testing and A/B analysis to compare conversion outcomes
- Evaluated statistical significance and practical impact
- Interpreted results to support leadership decision-making
